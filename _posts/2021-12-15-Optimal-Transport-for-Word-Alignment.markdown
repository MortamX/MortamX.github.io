From September 2021 to December 2021, I pursued a Research Project at LIMSI (Orsay, France) supervized by Fran√ßois Yvon. He introduced me to translation problems in NLP before I found my research subject. After going through numerous papers, I created my own solution for the word alignment problem called Optimal Transport for Cross-lingual Word Alignments.
