Born in Mexico, I grew up in the French countryside (Gers) before successfully entering Ecole Polytechnique in 2019. I am now a 3rd Year student specializing in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. This strong scientific basis brought me to move toward Artificial Intelligence by learning its cognitive inspirations, optimizing with Mathematics and creating with Machine Learning.

Skip-gram | Optimal Transport | Sinkhorn | Wasserstein GAN | NLP

### AI Intern, Fujitsu (Tokyo, Japan)

Developed numerous models, losses and metrics with great results. I worked on state of the art research at the crossroads of Computer Vision and NLP on a subject close to Vid2Text.

Optical-flow | Transformers | Attention | CNN | TCN | Pose estimation

### Research Project, MBDA (Paris, France)

Designing a surveillance system against drone attacks based on drone networks. I applied biological research on wolves behavior to the project.

C++ | Java | Python | RRT* | Genetic Algorithms | Markov Chains
